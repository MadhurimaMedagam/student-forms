        <h3>Know NITK Better</h3>
        <p>
          National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal is located in
          Mangalore City, Karnataka State, India. The Institute was established
          as Karnataka Regional Engineering College (KREC) in 1960, and upgraded
          as National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) in 2002.
          Mangalore is the headquarters of the coastal district of Dakshina
          Kannada, and boasts an important centre of education, business and
          trade in the state. Sri. U. Srinivasa Mallya, a visionary and a
          philanthropist, contributed immensely to the development of the
          coastal region of Karnataka, and his effort towards establishment of
          KREC (now NITK) is the most significant one. In recognition of his
          role as the founder and architect of the institute, the campus
          premises is named after him as Srinivasnagar.
